#  Sharmila Rapeti — Portfolio Chatbot

Welcome!   
This is my **interactive chatbot-style portfolio** — because reading a static CV is so 2010.  
Instead of scrolling through boring bullet points, you can *chat with my portfolio* and learn about me in a more natural, fun way.

##  Why a Chatbot Portfolio?

Because I wanted my portfolio to:
